		<p class="py-4 font-normal text-xl text-gray-100">
            Having been the sole developer of a few projects, I've figured my way around different tools and languages to suit the needs of the project which allowed me to gain experience in many fields.

        <div class="flex flex-col gap-4 py-4">
            <p class="font-normal text-xl text-gray-100">
                The langauge is among the languages that I've used a lot. I have to admit, despite its flaws, Java is quite the beautiful language but there is one issue that made me transition away from Java and that it's bulkiness in terms of file size and memory.

        <div class="flex flex-col gap-4 py-4">
            <p class="font-normal text-xl text-gray-100">
                Rust is the language that I've come to love the most. I've always thought in the past that no matter what language I've wrote something, it wouldn't matter but Rust proved me wrong especially when I needed something that used less memory while doing more than what Java could.
            </p>
            <p class="font-normal text-xl text-gray-100">
                The language has shattered my expectations many times and have brought scary improvements in both performance and efficiency onto most of the applications that I've transitioned parts of which into the language.

        <div class="flex flex-col gap-4 py-4">
            <p class="font-normal text-xl text-gray-100">
                Although hated by many of the community, PHP is still an incredible language for its use-case in the web. I've used PHP a lot and I've come to experience how comfortable and quick you can make stuff out of the language.
            </p>
            <p class="font-normal text-xl text-gray-100">
                I've come to love it more while trying out Laravel, the framework is as if magic. You can write an entire web application in a single day with full functionality.

		<p class="font-bold text-2xl text-gray-100">Why is it called Javascript?</p>
        <div class="flex flex-col gap-4 py-4">
            <p class="font-normal text-xl text-gray-100">
                This language is a cool one for web development, although I've used it a few times for other use-cases, I still think Javascript is sort of better used in web-development stuff but this is just an opinion of someone who've only written around six non-web Javascript applications.

            <p class="font-normal text-xl text-gray-100">
                Tailwind is my go-to CSS framework when I have the opportunity to, although it can make your HTML quite the mess, it can help you produce a delicious-looking website within moments. Is there any better than that?

        <div class="flex flex-col gap-4 py-4">
            <p class="font-normal text-xl text-gray-100">
                Docker is just magic. There is no other word to explain it but magic. I've once thought that I don't need Docker or I could just download, install everything myself but... I was so wrong. Docker simplified my life ten times over, need to install Redis with proper configuration... just run this one-liner command.

            <p class="font-normal text-xl text-gray-100">
                One of my favorite database and cache, Redis stands as the best in my list especially as a cache. It's simple, beautiful, quick to install and supersonic fast to the extent that it'd reduce the time it takes for my applications to grab something from the database by half.

            <p class="font-normal text-xl text-gray-100">
                MongoDB is among the first databases that I've come to love. I've first used it on my Discord bot after doing some research and I've sure come to love the NoSQL paradigm for i. MongoDB is performant, powerful and efficient which all what I wanted back then.

                MySQL and PostgreSQL are both my second go-to database and also the ones that I've used in several of my applications. It's my favorite when going for websites which is really where it tends to be used.

            <p class="font-normal text-xl text-gray-100">
                Sentry and Grafana are both my favorites in monitoring applications health and error logging. All my applications are linked with Sentry to notify me of when an error occurs on multiple users while Grafana is also used to help monitor any possiblity of a memory leak and so forth. It also helps me diagnose requests and the time it took to handle that request which can help in determining bottlenecks in the application.

            <p class="font-normal text-xl text-gray-100">
                Svelte stands as my most favorite Javascript framework because of how simple it is to get into as someone who is used to plain Javascript, HTML and CSS. It doesn't enforce you to use JSX or something which makes me happy.

            <p class="font-normal text-xl text-gray-100">
                Laravel is among my most favorite full-stack web frameworks so far. It has a huge community, ecosystem that makes you find the tools that you need to build a proper web application from a chat app, novel website, blog site and so forth in an hour.
