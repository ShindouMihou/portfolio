        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-black">Mana was started</h3>
        <p class="mb-4 text-sm font-light text-gray-500">
            At around August, 2020 GMT+8, I took up the task of replacing the emoji bot that my personal server
            used after it had closed down for multiple reasons. It was after taking a long break from programming, therefore it
            was theoretically, one of my first time in forever trying Java. At that time, the bot was not named Mana, but rather
            <b class="font-bold">Paradoxium</b>.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-sm font-light text-gray-500">
            Within the first two days of starting the bot, two features were added and those were tickets for moderation and
            searching of mangas from a sketchy, scraper site. It wasn't the best, but the integrations worked and that was what
            mattered to me at that time.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-sm font-light text-gray-500">
            And by the near end of the month, so many features such as quiz, memes, profiles, rankings, economies and author
            features were integrated onto the bot, officially making the bot into a multi-purpose bot.

            After some time of overpaying on bad servers, Mana finally took a seat on a very neat virtual private server
            where she and almost all of my projects before mid-2022 would stay and would be the last place that Mana would
            stay for her lifetime.

            Before being a Programmer, I was actively a webnovel writer for ScribbleHub, and there was a problem with a
            RSS bot that we used in my server where we could only add 5 feeds per server for free. I wanted to solve that
            problem, but specifically for authors in the same platform. So, Amelia was born and stands till today with
            over thousands of chapters notified.

        <p class="mb-4 text-sm font-light text-gray-500">
            After seeing how well Mana's waifuworld and yuriverse features were, I decided to create Waifulogy which was
            an anime image board full of all kinds of weirdness. It was one of my first times that I dabbled with image
            manipulation at a massive scale for me, at that time, around gigabytes per day.

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-black">I managed to lose all my websites.</h3>
        <p class="mb-4 text-sm font-light text-gray-500">
            As the title indicated, after messing around with Apache and PHP configurations... I somehow made an irrecoverable
            move that ended up destroying all servers and caused them to be down and also me to be up for the entire night.
            Among the sites that were taken down was Waifulogy, Mana and my personal site.

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-black">Quickbin was founded</h3>
        <p class="mb-4 text-sm font-light text-gray-500">
            And after realizing Hastebin was broken, I found my next web project and that was Quickbin which was a
            "simple, modern and lightweight bin" according to its description. It was created under a day and a half using...
            PHP only with no authentication at all.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-sm font-light text-gray-500">
            Quickbin received more features eventually with a public REST API, autocompletion and even team edit which allowed
            more than two people to edit the same bin and receive a Git-like synchronization. You can click
            <a class="text-blue-500" href="/quickbin_team_edit.mp4" target="_blank">here</a> to
            see the team edit feature.

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-black">RoseDB was created</h3>
        <p class="mb-4 text-sm font-light text-gray-500">
            After being curious about how to create a database, one of my first and pretty "fun" projects was created and that
            was RoseDB which was as the description says "A super simple, NoSQL database made in Java". It was ambitious to say the least,
            but it worked fine until I tried to deploy Amelia with it as the database on a Linux server... and well... it didn't work.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-sm font-light text-gray-500">
            But that didn't mean I didn't learn anything from the project, rather the opposite, I learned a lot about websockets,
            thread-safety, queues and how to write and read files in a synchronized yet still fast manner. I also learned about
            different ways to replicate and balance data and load to enable scaling.

            After one of Jikan's Java wrappers had vanished somehow, I decided to create my own Jikan API wrapper for Java and
            it eventually became one of the few that were simple, and very lightweight to use.

            such as a voting system, blog, hall of fame, etc.

            What makes this most surprising was that within the first few hours of announcing the project, the first phase

            After exceeding Sentry's trace logging, I decided that it was best to create my own logging stack, and Celebi was
            born. It was a closed-source trace logging stack completely written with Express, Javascript, Html and no other frameworks.
            It worked by combining MongoDB, Socket.io to enable high-volume transmission of logs from Mana with Express enabling the
            web viewer.

            Another two cool integrations that I included in Mana was Mashiro and Anti-scam, this was during the peak of Discord's
            scams where you could have a scam message every now and then. Mana did some very cool scanning techniques to identify
            scam and non-scams from a message and a link.
            <br>
            Mashiro was also released at this time which analyzed, classified and identifies data from a user's image bookmarks
            in Mana to enable personalized image suggestions. It was also another very cool feature, but heavy on CPU usage and had
            to be scaled up to six nodes at peak.
