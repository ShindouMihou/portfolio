## 🌃 My Portfolio
This is my official portfolio website written with the help of SvelteKit and Tailwind. There isn't much to look here, but I hope you enjoyed looking at the source code. You can also view the production version at https://mihou.pw which was deployed with https://pages.dev.

## 🍮 Time Taken
The entire website took a total of 2 hours and 33 minutes according to OBS, the process was streamed privately and had been the first Svelte project I've worked on with Tailwind.
